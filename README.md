# cosmocloudassignment

A new Flutter project i.e. Employee App Given by Cosmocloud for assignment task.

## Getting Started

In this application, I have developed a CRUD API using cosmocloud technology and integrated it with a MongoDB Cloud database. The API enables us to create, read, update, and delete data. A floating button allows users to add new employee details, while a delete button enables data removal. Additionally, a pencil icon is available for editing existing data.
